      <p>This is a computer iteration of the classic code-breaking game.</p>
      <p>You have a given number of rounds (depending on the selected difficulty) to deduce a code generated by the app. After every round, you'll receive feedback in a form of scoring balls.</p>
      <p>Every white ball represents a ball of the same colour that is present in the code, however the position is different. </p>
      <p>Every black ball represents a ball that is both: of the same colour and in the same position.</p>
      <p>If neither colour nor positioning matches, no scoring balls are displayed. Please note, that lack of scoring balls is a valuable piece of information as well!</p>
      <p>The game concludes after either: the provided code is broken, or after you've run out of available guesses.</p>
      <p>Beware, duplicates of the same balls are allowed.</p>
