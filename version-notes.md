#Mastermind 0.9

The aim of this version was to expand on the initial game.

The difficulty selection was added. In order to achieve that, some parts of the game needed to be redone, such as a simplified gameRestart function was introduced, with storageSession being used to pass the difficulty level for the next gaming session.

The Main Menu was added. In main menu the user can read the rules, select difficulty and start a new game.
